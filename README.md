The app (currently beta, while https://github.com/BayerC/open_cups/milestone/1 is not done) is available at <https://open-cups.streamlit.app/>.

##  Overview

OpenCups is a simple, intuitive tool that enables real-time feedback from the audience to presenters.
Participants use a simple traffic light system to signal their understanding:

- 🟢 **Green** → Following easily
- 🟡 **Yellow** → Need more explanation
- 🔴 **Red** → Cannot follow

The presenter sees a bar histogram of the current distribution and can then adapt to slow down when audiences struggle or speed up when everyone is on track.

### How to use:
Open https://open-cups.streamlit.app/ or [run locally](#run-locally)

1. Create a room
2. Share the link or room ID with the participants
3. They will join your room and share their status anonymously
4. The results will be shown as a bar diagram across all participants

## Run locally

1. `git clone https://github.com/BayerC/open_cups.git`
2. `cd open_cups/`
3. `Install uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/`
4. To run app locally: `uv run streamlit run main.py`

## Contributing

1. [Run locally steps](#run-locally)
2. Hook pre-commit into git: `uv run pre-commit install`
3. To run pre-commit manually run: `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`

### Dependency Management

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for dependency management:

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml): Defines dependencies with version constraints.
- [uv.lock](uv.lock): Lockfile with exact versions for all platforms. Committed to version control.
- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt): Auto-generated from [uv.lock](uv.lock) for deployment compatibility (e.g., Streamlit Cloud). DO NOT edit manually - it's regenerated by pre-commit hooks. Committed to version control for deployment platforms that don't support [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/https:/) natively.

## Relation to existing cups projects

This is a scalable, tested, and modern rewrite of https://github.com/fastai/fastcups in python using https://streamlit.io/ that supports multiple rooms hosted on the same server.

Other teaching institutions had this idea before, see for example [these](https://www.nwesd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/PROL_Colored_Cups_kdj.pdf) and [these](https://www.sstr2.org/Downloads/Cups%20as%20student%20feedback.pdf) instructions.
